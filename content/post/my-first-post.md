### Hi!
Welcome to my Blog! This is my first post. Itâ€™s been a while since I write on my blog.

I revamped and decided to blog again So I can retain information I learn. I tend to forget things ðŸ˜… (so many things to learn! I canâ€™t keep up). So now, I can now practice writing and retain information. Kill two birds with one stone! Hope I can make writing a habit!

My previous blog used `Hugo`, tried using other tools for this new Blog but I am more familiar with Hugo and itâ€™s simple to use. I deploy it on `Cloudflare`, I connected my `GitHub` repo and itâ€™s automatically deployed when I push on my `main` branch.

â€¨Thatâ€™s all for now.

Thanks!
