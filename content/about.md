## About Me
I am Bryan! I am from the Philippines. I am a software engineer with 9 years of experience, I work remotely for a startup, which gives me the flexibility to work from anywhere. I absolutely love using Vim as my go-to text editor. It's efficient and helps me code faster.

In my day-to-day work, I utilize a variety of technologies like Elixir, Phoenix, PostgreSQL, and Node.js. These tools allow me to build awesome software solutions and tackle exciting challenges.

Apart from coding. I have a range of interests that keep me entertained and inspired. I'm a big fan of anime, movies, and TV series, they provide me entertainment. Additionally, I'm a huge NBA enthusiast, eagerly following the thrilling basketball games.

This website serves as a personal space where I document and remember all the things I learn along the way. It's a platform where I can share my experiences, insights, and learnings.
